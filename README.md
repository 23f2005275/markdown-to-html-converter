# Light Theme Project

A simple, responsive web page built with plain HTML and styled using Tailwind CSS, featuring a clean and modern light theme.

## Features

- **Light Theme:** A visually comfortable interface with a bright color scheme.
- **Responsive Design:** Adapts seamlessly to various screen sizes, from mobile to desktop.
- **Modern UI:** Clean and intuitive layout for an enhanced user experience.
- **Single File:** All code contained within `index.html` for easy deployment and sharing.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5:** For the page structure.
- **Tailwind CSS:** For utility-first styling (via CDN).

## Getting Started

To view this project, simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser. No build steps or external dependencies (beyond the Tailwind CDN) are required.

```bash
# Just open the file
open index.html
```

## Project Structure

```
.                       
├── index.html          # The main HTML file with all content and styles
├── README.md           # This readme file
└── LICENSE             # MIT License file
```

## Customization

- **Colors:** Modify Tailwind CSS classes directly in `index.html` to change colors. The current theme uses a palette of `gray` and `blue` for primary accents.
- **Content:** Update the text and sections within the `<body>` tag to fit your project's needs.
- **Tailwind CSS:** Since it's loaded via CDN, you can use any Tailwind CSS utility class directly.
